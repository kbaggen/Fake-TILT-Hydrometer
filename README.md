# Fake-TILT-Hydrometer
Code for making a Fake Fat Pink TILT hydrometer from a BLE33 Sense sensor and a XXL Petling. The BLE33 Sense got both MPU for angle/tilt detection and also a temperature probe.

This code assmable a Fake TILT hence for how to use see --> https://iblopper.bubble-logger.com/fake-fat-pink-tilt/

You can change the colour of the TILT in below code. 

In put in some code also for using a DS18B20 sensor for temperature if someone wish to try use a BLE33 (none sense as this version do not have temperatyre probe on). That part of the code is untested.

Last, but not least then the USB serial is turn off to lower power drain. The version based on a big LiFePO4 battery 26650, should last 30-40 days.
